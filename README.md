# Picture Organizer

I had about 61GB of photos on a backup SSD that needed to have sorted, so I wrote a quick script that
sorts the pictures into sub-directories based on when they were taken. There are seperate directories for
files that had decoding errors, date errors, or files that aren't JPGs. I added a progress bar to track
how far into the directory the script was. However, it turns out that the progressbar was barely needed
because the program organized ~61GB in about 6 seconds.
